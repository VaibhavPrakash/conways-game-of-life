                <p>
                    Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation invented by
                    mathematician John Conway. It's a zero-player game, meaning
                    that its evolution is determined by its initial state,
                    requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of
                    cells, each of which can be alive or dead, and they evolve
                    through generations following a set of rules.
                </p>
                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <p>
                    You can interact with the Game of Life through the following
                    controls:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Start</strong>: Begins the simulation of generations.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Stop</strong>: Pauses the simulation.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Next Step</strong>: Advances the grid to the next
                        generation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reset</strong>: Resets the grid to a new random
                        pattern.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Rules of the Cells</h2>
                <p>
                    The evolution of the cells is determined by the following
                    rules:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Birth</strong>: A dead cell with exactly
                        <em>3</em> live neighbors becomes a live cell.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Survival</strong>: A live cell with
                        <em>2</em> or <em>3</em> live neighbors stays alive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Death</strong>: A live cell with fewer than
                        <em>2</em> or more than <em>3</em> live neighbors dies.
                    </li>
                </ol>
